# README

This API is part of a code challenge for Chargify, and it is not intended to be distributed or used for any other purpose without their consent. 


## USAGE

1. In order to protect the Fakepay API token, I've set up a `.env` file with the key I was given. In that file, the token is assigned to the variable `FAKEPAY_TOKEN`.
2. In lieu of traditional tests, the `frontend_test.rb` file is what I used to simulate a frontend making requests to my API
